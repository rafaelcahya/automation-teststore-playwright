## 🎭 Automation Testing with Playwright + Cucumber + Automation Test Store

Hey there! 👋 I'm using this repo to show how I automate UI testing for web applications using Playwright and Cucumber.
This project is integrated with Jenkins so tests run smoothly and automatically every time I update the code or on a schedule.

## 🎯 What's This Project About?
I'm testing key user features on Automation Test Store to make sure they work just like a user would expect. Here's what I’m focusing on:
1. 🔐 Login – Making sure login works with valid credentials
2. 🆕 Register – Testing new user registration
3. ❓ Forgot Password – Verifying the password reset process
4. 🧑‍💻 Forgot Login Name – Making sure username recovery works

## 🛠️ Tools I’m Using
Here’s the tech stack I’m working with:
1. Playwright – For browser automation (fast, modern, reliable)
2. Cucumber – For writing tests in human-readable Gherkin syntax
3. Jenkins – To automate and schedule test runs
4. Automation Test Store – My go-to site for demo and test automation
